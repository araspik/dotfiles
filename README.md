# My Configuration Files
Everyone has their own dotfiles. These are mine.
Comes with a handy installer script, with argument parsing and everything.

This is primarily because my distrohopping has a habit of f\*cking my data, and so this is my
backup.

### Installing
You want to use this? Great! Installation is dead simple and safe:

```sh
./setup.sh
```
This installs everything, and does not overwrite any files.

Advanced usage is available using the `-h` or `--help` option. The script is (in my opinion)
pretty complete in terms of a user interface (but not interactive); it can be used quite easily.

### License: None (but redistributors, mention me)
You may notice that my code contains multiple references to Stack Overflow answers, from where I
get useful programming knowledge. I always mention the URL (thus the author), so that others can
follow what I did. You can use my code however you want, except that when redistributing, a link to
this repository on GitHub must be mentioned where my code is used.
